Introduction to Neuroimaging Data Visualisaion in R
================

These notebooks were developed to be presented at the TrainTrack 2021
edition of the [OHBM BrainHack](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2021/).

This short series of R-notebooks will introduce to to some of the
neuroimaging data visualization tools R. You can work though these
notebooks on RStudio Cloud, or locally on Rstudio. If you are using
Rstudio cloud, or have git installed, clone this get repo by typing the
following in to the terminal:

`git clone sidchop/neuRo-vis-BrainHack-2021`

## Structure

We will go though how to visualize 4 different types of data:

-   [Voxel-level
    data](https://github.com/sidchop/neuRo-vis-BrainHack-2021/blob/main/nifti.Rmd)  

-   [ROI-level
    data](https://github.com/sidchop/neuRo-vis-BrainHack-2021/blob/main/roi.Rmd)  

-   [Edge-level
    data](https://github.com/sidchop/neuRo-vis-BrainHack-2021/blob/main/edge.Rmd)  

-   [Vertex-level
    data](https://github.com/sidchop/neuRo-vis-BrainHack-2021/blob/main/vertex.Rmd)
    *(Note: This note book will not work properly on RStudio Cloud due
    to space and RAM requirements)*  

## Pre-requisites

You will need a basic understanding of R syntax. A understanding of
R-Markdown syntax will be helpful, but not essential.
